## Gyroscope using Arduino UNO

### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to interface a gyroscope module with an Arduino UNO to measure orientation and angular velocity. The MPU6050 gyroscope module is utilized, providing both accelerometer and gyroscope data.

### Components Needed

1. **Arduino UNO Board**
2. **MPU6050 Gyroscope Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block diagram



### Circuit Wiring

1. **MPU6050 Module:**
   - Connect the VCC pin to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the GND pin to the GND pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the SDA pin to the A4 pin (SDA) on the Arduino.
   - Connect the SCL pin to the A5 pin (SCL) on the Arduino.

### Instructions

1. **Connect the Gyroscope Module:**
   - Wire the MPU6050 gyroscope module to the Arduino UNO according to the circuit wiring instructions.

2. **Upload the Code:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Verify and upload the code to your Arduino board.

3. **Monitor the Serial Output:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor to view the accelerometer and gyroscope data.
   - Ensure that the MPU6050 is successfully connected, and data is being read from the sensor.

### Project Operation

- **Initialization:**
  - The Arduino initializes serial communication and the MPU6050 module.

- **Data Reading:**
  - The Arduino continuously reads accelerometer and gyroscope data from the MPU6050 module.

- **Serial Output:**
  - The accelerometer and gyroscope data (in terms of acceleration and angular velocity) are printed to the Serial Monitor.

### Applications

- **Orientation Sensing:** Use the gyroscope module for orientation sensing in robotics or drone applications.
- **Motion Tracking:** Track the movement or rotation of objects in 3D space.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Implement gesture recognition systems based on motion data captured by the gyroscope.
